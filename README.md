## 🧐 About <a name="about"></a>

<strong>From 28 april 2023 to 18 may 2023</strong>

The goal of this project was to create a todo-list program based on Node.js, only on a backend side and by using Express and mysql.

## 💻 Features <a name="features"></a>

Our final result was 16/22. We achieved to implement the required features:
- A mysql database
- Every routes
- Authentification based on tokenisation (jsonwebtoken and bcryptjs modules)
- To keep informations in the db (users infos and todo-lists associated to them)

## ➕ To improve <a name="more"></a>

Here is why we didn't get all the points:
  - Error codes and messages (be careful with this)
  - Error handling (not directly asked on the subject but still mandatory)

## 🤖 Testing the program <a name="tests"></a>

Coming soon...

## 📆 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

I had a hard time understanding how do javascript and mysql were working (fortunately Elouan was here to save us lmao) but this project sure did help us discovering these new languages, above all after a whole year doing C. We were still disappointed to see that we had a D grade even with 16 points so don't do the same mistakes and don't forget to check error handling and error messages/codes.
